## About

Copilot Ops allows users to generate new Kubernetes YAML files by simply describing what they need within a GitHub issue.
Iterate on your Kubernetes projects quickly with the help of AI-powered tooling.

---
## Installation

You can install Copilot Ops from the [GitHub app page](https://github.com/apps/copilot-ops).
Once you've installed the bot, follow the post-install directions in [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md#installation) to complete the setup.

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for details on bot usage and installation.

In general, the bot can be interacted with using the `/[command]` format.
When in doubt, try the `/help` command for an overview of command usage.
You can view the full list of commands [here](./USAGE.md#commands).


<!-- ### Re-generating pull requests 

Pull requests can be regenerated by using the `/reroll` command on the original issue.
This will cause the bot to perform another generation of data using the
original issue as input.
<!-- TODO: allow input to be provided on either the issue or pull request -->

<!-- ### Customizing bot behavior

Bot behavior can be customized by including a `.copilot-ops.yaml` file in your project's root directory. This file can include the following customization options:

- **backend:** define the AI backend for file generation. Current options are `gpt-3`, `gpt-j`, `opt`, and `bloom`.
- **filesets:** define filesets within the config for reference in later issue labels or manually as needed.
- **gpt3:** define a specific config for gpt-3 generations. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/djach7/copilot-ops).
- **gptj:** define a specific config for gpt-j generations. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/djach7/copilot-ops).
- **bloom:** define a specific config for bloom generations. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/djach7/copilot-ops). -->

<!-- An example `.copilot-ops.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
backend: bloom
filesets:
  - name: examples
    files:
      - examples/*.yaml
  - name: stock-data
    files:
      - examples/stock-data.yaml
``` -->
